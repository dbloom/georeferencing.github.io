Georeferencing is an essential component of data completeness and fitness for use for biodiversity data. To promote the best practices in georeferencing, weâ€™ve developed an extensive collection of reference materials, tools and other resources for georeferencers everywhere.

Georeferencing.org is a community-driven resource. Its goal is to (1) help georeferencers find the tools and resources they need and (2) allow members of the community to support each other by adding resources to this site for others to use. If you have resources to add to this site, or if you find any broken links, please [contact us]()/contact/ so we can keep this site as current as possible.
